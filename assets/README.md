## Overview

This folder serves as a central repository for assets essential to your portfolio website. It is organized into subfolders to manage styles (CSS and SCSS), images (img) efficiently. These assets play a pivotal role in shaping the visual and interactive elements of your website.

## Folder Contents

    -   **styles/**
        -   **css/**: The main CSS file for styling your website.
        -   **scss/**: The SCSS source file for advanced styling.
    -   **img/**: Contains images for your portfolio. (Optional)

## Usage

The assets within this folder are integral to your portfolio website's design and functionality. The `styles` subfolder houses stylesheets that define the visual aesthetics of your site, while the `img` subfolder contains images that enhance the user experience.

Feel free to import and apply these assets as needed throughout your website. They serve as the foundation for achieving a visually appealing and well-structured portfolio without the need for extensive custom coding.
