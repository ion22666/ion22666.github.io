# src Folder

## Overview

The "src" folder is the heart of Next.js project, where we can organize and manage source code of sections. It contains two essential subfolders: "components" and "contents." These folders play distinct roles in shaping the portfolio website.

## Usage

-   **Components Folder**: The "components" folder contains reusable components that you can import and use throughout your portfolio website. These components help maintain consistency and simplify development.

-   **Contents Folder**: The "contents" folder stores JSON files containing the content and data used on your website. You can fetch and display this data dynamically within your pages and components.

Feel free to customize, extend, or create new components and content files to tailor your portfolio to your specific needs. This structure promotes organization and separation of concerns, making your project more maintainable and scalable.
